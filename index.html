                <p><em>Founder & CEO Of <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oyKSLjAS5Y">My Own Future & Destiny</a></strong></em></p>
                <p>I have let years of my life go on without taking a hold of it. I have been scared and timid about grabbing life by the horns. Today I say bring it on and watch me prove to myself and the world that I am amazing. Self-Doubt is something that has been in my life most of my life because of others projecting their fears, truths, and ugly behavior as me when it was themselves, they were speaking of. I was raised by a go getter so I know how to do these things I just have to be about them and stand on my word. I realized that this was important not only to me but for my son as well. I had an example so I feel as if it's only right for him to see that in me as well. My son is watching me and my inner child is watching me, I need to prove to both that Our people are capable of so much more. I am a child of the lord our God Yeshua, Yahweh, and Ruach and I am beautifully created with slanted almond eyes, smooth milk chocolate skin, and have dangerously enticing curves. To be honest it took me this long at the age of 30 to be able to give myself such compliments and not feel guilty or wrong for feeling that way. As I get older and my life line expands, I realize that I LOVE ME SOME ME!!! For so long that was my challenge because so many people would make front of me as a child and I let it stay with me for way too long. This is my coming out story of me and why I love me and why I am strong, beautiful, and capable of anything. I always thought that I didn't have a talent but now I realize that I have way too many. So many that I allowed other people’s perception of me to block my true feelings about me and who I am.</p></td>

    <h3>My Work Ethic & Experience</h3>
    <p>Many people love to believe the notion that they love money, but the truth is that you love what it can do for you. I love it as the great tool it is that allows me to take care of my family, myself, and so much more. This is one of many reasons why my work ethic is something amazing because I know my why’s. And because of this I am an amazing employee, associate, teammate, partner, and business friend. I am diligent at completing my work goals and providing great service. I strive to get things done, do it my best the first time, and accept any feedback that will make me or my project better. Learning and Knowledge is the best thing about sculpting your craft because it’s always an honor to learn more. </p>
