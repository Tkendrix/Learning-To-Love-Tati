        <h1>Lay It On The Line 📞</h1>
        <h3>Lay Your Worries, Fears, Hopes, Dreams, Wants, Desires, and Needs All Right Here.</h3>
    <p>I understand what not being able to say how you feel out loud or what you feel out loud. Here is where you can lay it on the line, here on my contact page. Whatever you might be feeling, not able to feel, or not trying to feel... I am here for it all. People don’t always need to be in your life for a lifetime, yes, we want that and hope for that but what happens when it’s not working, and you know it. Or what about when it is working but you don’t feel like you deserve it, so you sabotage it. Or what about when you are confused and can see both sides of the situation and how it can be good and bad? We ALL go through this... And Everyone needs a shoulder, and I am willing to do that. Leave all of you Hate, Desire, Dreams, & even doubts right here and go after the life you want because that is what this page is for. People love telling you to leave your pain in the past but here you can lay it to rest. Let go of it because if you don’t then it will take over you and your life. And then after you lay it to rest then give me positive dreams, desires and goals then GO AFTER THEM. Standing still and not doing anything to make it happen won’t make it happen, you have to get out there and stop being afraid of failing, success, or whatever it is that is holding you back.</p>
